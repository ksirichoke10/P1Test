## **1 Introduction**
TODOList is an Android application that manages to-do lists. This application supports multiple users, multiple lists per user, and priority and due date for each item in a list. Users of the application are able to add, delete, and edits tasks on their lists. Tasks on the list will be automatically saved after modification. In addition, TODOList allows users to check-off each task after completion. 

### **1.1 Definitions and Acronyms**

- **TODOList** - Android application that manages to-do lists

- **EP** - Evolutionary Prototyping

- **Prototype** - An initial sample or model of a product

- **Android** - An operating system that is based on the Linux kernel. It is designed for mobile devices that are primarily touchscreen, such as tablets and smartphones.

- **Evolutionary Prototyping** - A software process model that deals with designing and implementing an initial prototype and refining the prototype until it is acceptable for release.

## **2 Process Description**

### **2.1 Project Lifecycle**

Evolutionary prototyping will be used to manage the TODOList project. The TODOList project will progress through the following phases:

*Initial Concept -> Design of initial prototype -> Implementation of initial prototype -> Refine prototype -> Complete and release prototype*

After the TODOList team gathers the requirements from the customer, a working UI prototype will be created and delivered to the customer for early feedback. Once feedback is received, the project team will design and implement the prototype of the application based on customer�s requirements and early feedback. Updated versions of the prototype is delivered to the customer for feedback until the prototype is finally acceptable for release.

- **Initial Concept** - The initial concept of the application is discussed with the customer and requirements are gathered. The UI prototype is created based on customer�s requests and delivered to customer for early feedback.

- **Design of initial prototype** - Design of the application, which includes the architectural design, low level design, and user interface design.

- **Implementation of initial prototype** - Developer implements the application based on given requirements. Testing is performed on the application against test cases before the application is delivered to the customer for feedback.

- **Refine prototype** - Feedback from customer is taken into consideration and prototype is revised/extended. The prototype is continuously refined based on customer�s feedback until customer labels the prototype as acceptable for release.

- **Complete and release prototype** - Customer is happy with the latest version of the prototype and the prototype is released to the public.


### **2.2 Process Activities**

1) 

 - **Phase** - Initial Concept
 -  **Activity Name** - Speak to customer
 -  **Activity Description** - Team speaks to customer to get the general idea of what customer wants
 -  **Entrance criteria** - Schedule meeting with customer
 -  **Exit criteria** - Good understanding of customer�s requests

2)

- **Phase** - Initial Concept
- **Activity Name** - Gather requirements
- **Activity Description** - Requirements specified by the customer are documented
- **Entrance Criteria**- Project�s scope is clearly defined
- **Exit criteria**- Requirements Document is completed and delivered to customer for review

3)

- **Phase** - Initial Concept
- **Activity Name** - Create UI prototype
- **Activity Description** - An initial UI prototype is created based on customer�s requirements
- **Entrance Criteria**- Customer's requirements are clearly defined
- **Exit Criteria**- Receive feedback from customer on prototype, Process Plan Document, and Requirements Document

4)

- **Phase** - Designing of initial prototype
- **Activity Name**  - Software and architectural design of application
- **Activity Description**- Create software design using a standard modeling tool (UML). Also, architect creates the architectural design of the application.
- **Entrance Criteria** - Customer signs-off on Requirements Document and provides feedback on UI prototype
- **Exit Criteria** - Design Document is complete


5)

- **Phase** - Implementing initial prototype
- **Activity Name** - Code application
- **Activity Description**- Implement application based on requirements 
- **Entrance Criteria**- Draft of design document is completed
- **Exit Criteria**- Unit testing completed


6)

- **Phase** - Refining prototype
- **Activity Name** - Deliver latest version of prototype to customer
- **Activity Description**- Team delivers prototype to customer. Based on customer�s feedback, the team will either edit/extend the prototype or release the latest version to the public.
- **Entrance Criteria**- Implementation of initial/updated versions of prototype complete
- **Exit Criteria**- Customer provides feedback on delivered prototype

7)

- **Phase** - Refining prototype
- **Activity Name** - Edit/extend prototype
- **Activity Description**- Feedback is taken into consideration and the prototype is edited/extended and tested before being delivered back to the customer for review. 
- **Entrance Criteria**- Feedback is received from customer
- **Exit Criteria**- Prototype is updated and delivered back to customer for feedback

8)

- **Phase** - Complete and Release prototype
- **Activity Name** - Approved by customer
- **Activity Description**- The latest version of the prototype is approved by the customer and is ready for release to the public
- **Entrance Criteria**- Latest version of prototype is delivered to customer for feedback
- **Exit Criteria**- Customer approves for release
