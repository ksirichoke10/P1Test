## **1 Introduction**
TODO is an Android application that manages TODO lists. This application supports multiple users, multiple lists per user, and priority and due date for each item in a list. Users of the application are able to add, delete, and edits tasks on their lists. Tasks on the list will be automatically saved after modification. In addition, TODO allows users to check-off each task after completion. 

### **1.1 Definitions and Acronyms**

- **TODO** - Android application that manages TODO lists

- **EP** - Evolutionary Prototyping

- **Prototype** - An initial sample or model of a product

- **Android** - An operating system that is based on the Linux kernel. It is designed for mobile devices that are primarily touchscreen, such as tablets and smartphones.

- **Evolutionary Prototyping** - A software process model that deals with designing and implementing an initial prototype and refining the prototype until it is acceptable for release.

## **2 Process Description**

### **2.1 Project Lifecycle**

Evolutionary prototyping will be used to manage the TODO project. The TODO project will progress through the following phases:

Initial Concept -> Design of initial prototype -> Implementation of initial prototype -> Testing of initial prototype -> Refine prototype -> Complete and release prototype

After the initial concept of the application is discussed with the customer, a UI prototype will be created and delivered to the customer for early feedback. Once feedback is received, the project team will design and implement the prototype of the application based on customer’s requirements and early feedback. Updated versions of the prototype is delivered to the customer for feedback until the prototype is finally acceptable for release.

- **Initial Concept** - The initial concept of the Android application is discussed with the customer and requirements are gathered. The UI prototype is created based on customer’s requests and delivered to customer for early feedback.

- **Design of initial prototype** - Design of the application that includes the architectural design, low level design, and user interface design.

- **Implementation of initial prototype** - Developer implements the application based on given requirements. Testing is performed on the application against test cases before the application is delivered to the customer for feedback.

- **Refine prototype** - Feedback from customer is taken into consideration and prototype is revised/extended. The prototype is continuously refined based on customer’s feedback until acceptable for release.

- **Complete and release prototype** - Customer is happy with the latest version of the prototype and the prototype is released to the public.
